# Contributing to Docs

Our docs are configured to build automatically from this subfolder. Read the docs prefers a markup system called "Sphinx," but we have Markdown support enabled, so we can import readmes from our Git repositories directly. Confluence syntax needs slightly more cleanup.

## Editing the Index

The `index.rst` file has, frankly, not received a lot of attention from me at this point because it needs to be written in Sphinx. It could look a lot nicer and should; right now I just use it to list the other Markdown documentation files.
